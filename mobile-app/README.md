# Kingly Cash Chess Mobile App

Expo React Native mobile version of the Game Hub with AdMob integration.

## Setup

1. Install Expo CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd mobile-app
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## AdMob Configuration

The app is configured with AdMob using your app ID: `ca-app-pub-7196290945919417~2175417759`

### Important: Update Ad Unit IDs

Before publishing, you need to create ad units in your AdMob dashboard and update the ad unit IDs in `src/config/admob.ts`:

1. Go to [AdMob Console](https://apps.admob.com/)
2. Create ad units for:
   - Banner ads
   - Interstitial ads
   - Rewarded ads
3. Replace the placeholder ad unit IDs in the config file

### Test Mode

The app runs in test mode during development (`__DEV__ = true`), which shows test ads. This prevents invalid clicks on your account.
